### Hi, I'm Jackson ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) working in the [UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/). My work focuses on public interest technology, the use of government data, and open-source software. I aim to be an applied researcher, producing software and knowledge that benefit the public through building large-scale data access systems that encourage civic participation.

For more details about me, [see my website](https://jacksonmaxfield.github.io).
