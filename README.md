### Hi, I'm Jackson ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at the
[University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/)
working under [Dr. Nicholas Weber](https://nicweber.info/) and
[Dr. Bill Howe](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/) in the
[UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/). I research and build open
access infrastructures largely pertaining to municipal governments
and large research institutions.

For more details about me, [see my website](https://jacksonmaxfield.github.io).
